## Introduction

This time, however, you'll implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!

The simulator will provide you the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.

## Rubric Points
 **PID controller**: *Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.*

 A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) calculates the difference between a desired set-point 
 (demand signal) and measured process variable (feedback estimate) to calculate an error signal. In this example the error signal
 is the CTE or deviation from the lane center. To get a reasonable system response the controller uses three components, namely:  
 proportional, integral, derivative. Each component has favourable and complementary characteristics. The proprtional component provides a 
 demand signal (steering angle) proportional to the CTE so steering angle increases proprtional to CTE - however with this controller alone CTE can never be zero.
 The integral component complements the proportional component and accumulates the CTE enabling a non-zero steady state steering angle to remove residual CTE error 
 that is there with only proportional control. The derivative component if well tuned imporoves system performance by dampening oscillations as a result of the other two components.
 

**PID controller design**: *Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen*

If the system the PID was controlling was fully known then a model could be developed. 
Open-loop design techniuqes could then be applied to generate =the desired system step response for a rqeuired overshoot, settling time etc.
In the absence of a model the twiddle algorithm was used as described in the lectures. The simulation was run with a given PID parameter set, 
the CTE was evealued and  parameteres were tuned. For each given parameter set the simulation was restarted to a known state to compare CTE.

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
